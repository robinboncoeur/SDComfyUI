# Stable Diffusion and ComfyUI
I'm just sharing my workflows and insights using ComfyUI. There's nothing official about what I'm discovering or doing: Your Mileage May Vary.

The workflows will be described below with links to the .json files. The images will laso have embedded .json code, so the reader can just drop the image into ComfyUI to see the workflow.

This is a constant WIP: the workflows "scratch my own itch" and I'm happy to share. If you find them useful,or find issues or whatever, drop me a line at the subreddit - I'm BubblyPace3002. Cheers...
