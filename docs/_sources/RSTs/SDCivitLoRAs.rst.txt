Notes on LoRAs
**************

**Aug, 2023**

*This information was current in August, 2023. At the rate of development in AI imagining, it'll be obsolete in weeks, in all likelihood. SDXL had just come out, which was going to be a major game-changer*.

**Oct, 2023**

The whole concept of LoRAs has been set in question (in ComfyUI, at least) with the development of IPAdapter, and its smarter cousin: `IPAdapter-Plus  <https://github.com/cubiq/ComfyUI_IPAdapter_plus>`_. Instead of developing LoRAs to fill a specific need, requiring a fairly beefy GPU with lots of VRAM, **IPAdapter+** can now be cosidered a 'few-image LoRA'.

Initial tests of this technology look quite promising. Here's the base node-set - just need to attach Sampler of choice, VAEDecode and SaveImage:

...and here's the output using roop:

Unfortunately, the fact that the woman on the image left appears to be looking at the woman with the marroon top is accidental and not reproduceable.

            * Okay, so maybe there's a bit of an Edwardian and Baroque influence in there as well, but we're not striving for historical accuracy here... just lots of pretty lace. 
            * Main tag is **victorian dress**. Other dress-adjacent tags like **lace**, **lace overlay**, **ruffles**, **brooch**, **bustle**, **bodice**, and so on and so forth... enjoy.

        Facial and hand distortions are directly linked to the optimal render dimensions, set in the 'Empty Latent Image' node. Optimal default dimensions will be safetensor-specific.

        Settings:
            * epiCRealism_NaturalSinRC1VAE: 512 * 768
            * LoRA add_detail: .476 * .524
            * Hand and facial distortion appear to be improving: they're significantly less. Dress detail enhanced by setting CLIP-skip to -2 in ComfyUI.

My Notes:
    * So far, this has been a consistent clothing item, with overall predictability, except for skirt length, which can vary, unfortunately. Would prefer not to have a 'can-can' length appear. Might write to the developer on this.
    * Colours are muted. Materials are inconsistent when two characters wear the same dress.

        Artist's Notes:
            * I will showcase this model publicly for the purpose of academic research and discussion, hoping to explore working methods together with everyone. 
            * I strongly recommend against uploading any NSFW content generated by this model. 
            * You are warmly welcomed to communicate with me here on how to improve the working methods and make the model more realistic.
            * If you have any suggestions, such as choosing different base models, using more images for training, increasing training steps, or adjusting training size to achieve a more realistic overall effect, please feel free to comment below.
            * Generally, I do not support the generation of adult content using this model. 
            * When using this model, please ensure compliance with local laws and regulations and avoid infringing upon others' rights to reputation, privacy, or likeness.
            * If this Lora has infringed upon your rights, please contact me, and I will take it down for processing.
        
My Notes:  
    * Significant face distortion with this dress. However, I'm also trying out the Ultimate SD Upscale node, which is giving me significantly better resolution. Even the details seem clearer. Note: *I was struggling with ComfyUI workflow when I wrote that comment*.
    * [23.09.11] - Retested: this dress is producing reliably consistent lovely renders. The dress appears in a variety of styles and layout of lace. Colour is no more or less consistent than other dresses of similar style.

        The artist offers no comments at all. Trigger word is **rose**.
        
        My Notes:
            * I'm trialing the Ultimate SD Upscale node, inserted before the roop sequences. Not sure if that matters. The faces appear cleaner and more distinct. Limbs leave a lot to be desired (upscaler cfg = .500).
            * The dresses themselves render sharp and clean, excellent detail.
            * Prompts make less of an impact than settings
            * Green dresses: full body shot, masterpiece, 2 beautiful Nordic buxom women, dark hair in bun, dark green velour Victorian dresses, long skirt with ruffles, bodice, lace, (mascara, eye-shadow, lipstick), a rose garden, cloudy evening,
            * Ivory and coloured dresses: full body shot, masterpiece, 2 beautiful Nordic buxom women, dark hair in bun, Victorian, long skirt with ruffles, bodice, lace, (mascara, eye-shadow, lipstick), a rose garden, cloudy evening,
            * Each of the following images show a progression of node setting changes

The change from having Ultimate SD Upscale node last to directly after the KSampler and before the roop sequences made all the difference. It appears that the Ultimate SD Upscale cfg needs to match that of the KSampler (7.000).

            * Welcome home m'Lord~
            * Unlike `my cute maid dress <https://civitai.com/models/133377/cute-maid-dress>`_, a Victorian maid outfit is far more about utility than flare.
            * Long, functional aprons feature prominently on this style, but it is not entirely bereft of appeal with puffy sleeves and beautiful brooches and bows common.
            * Main tag is **maid**, with other useful tags being **bow**, **brooch**, **long dress**, etc.

            * The main colors of the suit are black and white.
            * This model is suitable for most business scenarios, I believe that the standard suit can help you.
            * It can be a separate white/black shirt, or a separate black suit, or it can be a combination of different outfits.
            * This model is recommended to match the Majic realistic series, and the effect is better with the good film wind lora.
            * You can use keywords to control some scene changes, such as a solid color background for professional photography, or other scene uses.
            * Recommended parameter setting: iteration steps 25-35, amplification algorithm: 4x-UltraSharp, redrawing range 0.1-0.3 (more than picture effect decline), it is recommended to open ADetailer, Majic model is not recommended to open face repair.
            
Artist's Note (cont):

    * Because the whole network has not yet seen a similar formal professional clothing Lora, so specially produced and shared to everyone, I hope to bring convenience to you, the model still needs to be upgraded, like friends please leave a like, share your work!

My Notes:
    * *Left a comment on CivitAI page*: Truly a lovely suit, very elegant. Unfortunately, it affects my roop - changes the face. Other outfits don't appear to have this problem. Is there a CLIP-skip setting to invoke or some other setting I need to use? BTW, I'm in ComfyUI, not A1111.

        Artist's Notes:
            * Significantly improve the effect, I am personally very satisfied, the applicability is much stronger
            * Reduce the problem of overfitting, use in combination with other characters lora, weighting 0.6-0.9
            * Optimize the 2.5D/3D model, recommend using Rev animated
            * This is a Lora made at the request of a friend. I hope they will be satisfied with it.
            * Usage: Most anime-style models can be used, while 3D models may need some adjustments. Recommended weight is between 0.6 and 0.9.
            * **Garter straps** can be replaced with **pantyhose**.
            * If combining with other character LoRAs, weight may need to be adjusted to 0.4-0.7.
            * If necessary, you can add "(head out of frame:2)" to the negative prompt.
            * 
            * 

My Notes:
    * 23.09.05 @ 0620: can't say I'm impressed. Distorts my girl's hands (CLIP-Skip has nil effect)
    * When it works, it's fairly tarty, so not a fan.

        Artist's Note:
            * I made this Lora for my game, and don't mind sharing it. Well, suppose you want to create a couple of scenes with your character wearing the exact same clothes in different poses and sets. This Lora can help you out.
            * Most of the time it will create a white sweater, blue jeans and high heels (if visible). Can make variations of that - topless, bra, only sweater on, etc.
            * Tags: ddsweater, ddjeans
            * Additional tags and properties: if you want a topless variant put 'ddsweater' in the negative and add 'topless' to the prompt. If you want only the sweater variation do vice versa (bottomless and ddjeans in neg).
            * Color of the sweater and jeans could be changed, but I suggest using cutoff extension to not let SD mix colors. Flexible enough to be used with other Loras. Enjoy.
            * Prompt: posing, ddjeans, ddsweater, evil smile, 1girl, annoyed, irritated, waiting, city, <lora:DDsj_1.2:0.75>,  <lora:Viv(d2):0.75>

**23.09.04**:
    * I did five (5) renders: jeans never appeared. I finally added "wearing jeans" to the prompt. They appeared, finally, but would disappear again for no reason.
    * Initial renders distorted my "roop girl's" face so, just as an idea, I added a **CLIP-Skip** of -2, which fixed the problem. Hands were still distorted.
    * Several renders later, the hand distortion grew worse. Could be the openPose file causing it, though.
    * I like the sweater style: real clothing is always nicer and more versatile than tarty stuff. Have to just through a few hoops to get it to work, though.
    * @2150, did a render with "wearing jeans, wearing an oversized sweater" which is actually yielding better images. I'm disinclined to use this LoRA very much.

            * Better Leggings
            * Why stick for normal leggings when they can be better?

        Prompt:

My Notes:
    * There doesn't appear to be a photo-real use case for this
    * Have not yet tried this item [23.09.03]
    * Looks to be manga-focused

**23.09.04**
    * LoraLoader set at: str_model - 0.7, str_clip - 0.5. Appears to push prompt-based "oversized sweater" up out of the way. Made (sweater) first in prompt: sweater is now over the leggings (instead of oddly pulled up) but my girl's face has changed: however, that was transient. Next render: the leggings disappeared.

        Artist's Notes:
            * Training settings: 36 images, 20 steps, 13 epochs, you find many epochs (with test images using plot xy script) on my Patreon while supporting me.
            * Make sure you are aware on the usage instructions of LORA
            * Sampler: DPM++ SDE Karras (Recommended for best quality, you may try other samplers)
            * CFG Scale : 5 to 9
            * LORA weight for txt2img: reccomended 0.2-0.7 (i used 0.5 in my images).
            * Keys: oversized_hoodie, oversized_sweater
            * This LoRA is very easy to use, usually works with any color, just repeat the keyword with the color, like "oversized_sweater, red oversized_sweater"
            * In my images i gave a weight of 1.3 to the keyword oversized_sweater or hoodie, and i placed the keyword at the beginning of the prompt.

Most of the images of the training are with hoddie/sweater with naked legs, but some of them have boots or stocking, so if you want them you might try to add it to your prompt. Checkpoint used to generate the images: Chillout. Enjoy!

Prompt:
    * medium shot, natural light, oversized_sweater, eating, ramen, chopsticks, (medium_breasts:0.8), (large_breasts:0.3), (freckles:0.7), face, nose, cute, (young woman:1.2), (anna kendrick:0.95) (hailee steinfeld:0.3) (emma watson:0.4), ethnicity (canadian:1.1) (european:1.1) (asian:-1.55), hair (blonde:0.8) (brunette:1.2), looking away, slight smile, breasts, (nipples:0.7), (implied nude:0.4), <lora:oversized_sweater:0.2>,  <lora:ramen_v4:0.5>
