        (epinikion)

        Suggestions:

            * use simple prompts - keywords like 'masterpiece, best quality, 8k, intricate, high detail' or '(extremely detailed face), (extremely detailed hands), (extremely detailed hair)' are ineffective: they don't produce an appreciable change
            * use simple negatives or small negative embeddings. gives most realistic look (check samples to get an idea of negatives I used)
            * add 'asian, chinese' to the negative prompt for ethnicities other than Asian
            * Light, shadows, and details are excellent without extra keywords
            * If you're looking for a natural effect, avoid the word 'cinematic'
            * avoid using '1girl' since it pushes the model to render anime style
            * too much description of the face will generally result in a bad render most of the time
            * for a more fantasy-like output use the 2M Karras Sampler
            * no extra noise-offset is needed, but feel free to do so
            * ...
            * ...
            * ...

Best approach:

    * Prompt: simple explanation of the image. Try at first without extra keywords.
    * Negative: 'cartoon, painting, illustration, (worst quality, low quality, normal quality:2)'
    * Steps: > 20 (if image has errors or artefacts use higher Steps)
    * CFG Scale: 5 (higher config scale can lose realism, depends on prompt, sampler and Steps)
    * Sampler: any sampler (SDE, DPM-Sampler will result in more realism)
    * Size (dimensions): 512x768 or 768x512
    * Hires upscaler: 4x_NMKD-Superscale-SP_178000_G (Denoising: 0.35, Upscale: 2x)

Useful Extensions

    * !After Detailer | ControlNet | Agent Scheduler | Ultimate SD Upscale
    * No VAE *needed*, but it is recommended to use one for more vibrant colors

        You can view the work Ken has created using this and other models `on Instagram <https://www.instagram.com/ken_aiart/>`_.

        *Suggestions for use below the version release notes*.
        
        **2023/08/05 ver. 1.5 released**. Ver 1.5 has more background drawing. It will draw a detailed background even with only a single word, and will reflect detailed specifications to a reasonable degree. The figures are as realistic as in past versions, but the fingers are not as well drawn, so you will need to use LORA or embeddings to compensate for this.

        **2023/06/30 ver. 1.2.3 released**. This model is an improved version of v1.2. I am good at bust-up pictures of Japanese women. 20s to 40s and a wide range of age groups. It is not quite good at portraying the whole body. Please refer to the gallery.

        **2023/06/07 ver. 1.4 released**. While ver.1.3 specialized in Asian women, ver.1.4 has been adjusted so that European women can be drawn. Please use it according to your preference.

**05/31 New version 1.3 was uploaded**. Compared to 1.2, it is closer to Asian style and will output portrait-like images of young women. It also inherits some of the features of 1.2, so depending on the prompts, you can also draw beautiful mature women!

The contents of v1.2 are the same as the previous version, and the models are good at drawing photo-realistic Asian MILFs.

Negative prompt: (middle age,adult,mother,mature female,milf:2) for the negative prompt, a young woman can also be output.

**Ken's Notes on His Checkpoint merge in use**

        **Photon** aims to generate photorealistic and visually appealing images effortlessly.

        Recommendation for generating the first image with Photon:

            * Prompt: A simple sentence in natural language describing the image.
            * Negative: "cartoon, painting, illustration, (worst quality, low quality, normal quality:2)"
            * Sampler: DPM++ 2M Karras | Steps: 20 | CFG Scale: 6
            * Size: 512x768 or 768x512
            * Hires.fix: R-ESRGAN 4x+ | Steps: 10 | Denoising: 0.45 | Upscale x 2

        Pro tip: avoid using negative embeddings unless absolutely necessary.

        From this initial point, experiment by adding positive and negative tags and adjusting the settings. Most of the sample images follow this format. I hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed creating it! If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to share. Have fun creating amazing images!

**Development**

The development process was somewhat chaotic but essentially:

    * It started from an old mix.
    * LORAs were trained on various topics using AI-generated photorealistic images.
    * These LORAs were mixed within the model using different weights.
    * In the midst of this mixing, hand generation broke.
    * LORAs were generated and remixed in an attempt to fix hand generation (not entirely successful).

In future versions, I will try to:

    * Completely eliminate the need for a negative prompt to generate high-quality images.
    * Fix the hand generation issue to minimize instances of poorly drawn hands.
    * Explore more automated training processes. I would love to have 5,000 or 50,000 high-quality AI-generated photorealistic images for training purposes.


Sample Prompt:

    * (masterpiece:1.2), (best quality), (ultra detailed), (8k, 4k, intricate),(full-body-shot:1), (highly detailed:1.2),(detailed face:1.2), (detailed background),detailed landscape, ((portrait)), (dynamic pose:1.2)  <lora:more_details:0.5> <lora:siggy:0.7>siggy, 1girl, solo, long hair, breasts, looking at viewer, smile, skirt, blonde hair, large breasts, simple background, gloves, long sleeves, white background, holding, cleavage, hair between eyes, jewelry, closed mouth, green eyes, wide sleeves, necklace, mole, cross, staff, armlet, holding staff, nun, habit

        (WhoSawWhatSis)

        This is a blend of models that I've been working on for a while, with the primary goal of creating realistic character portraits in a variety of genres, but it's a well-rounded model that's been good at everything I've thrown at it. It's probably not very good at anime, but if that's what you're after there are plenty of other models to choose from.

        This model inherits the CreativeML Open RAIL-M and Dreamlike License. By downloading, you agree to both.

        No need to use a VAE. The model has vae-ft-mse-840000-ema-pruned.ckpt baked in. I also strongly recommend using the following negative embeddings: neg-sketch-2 by JPPhoto and neg-anime by dwringer.

        The example images were done with InvokeAI. If you want to reproduce them with a1111, you'll need to convert the syntax.
        
        Note: `InvokeAI <https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI/releases>`_ *is a leading creative engine built to empower professionals and enthusiasts alike.

        SinkIn.ai hosts the best Stable Diffusion models on fast GPUs. You can run MajicMIX Realistic at: https://sinkin.ai/m/yBG2r9O

        v2.5 is here. Note that this is not v7, but an upgrade for v2. V7 may need to address more issues, which I am still trying to do. In the process, I have created a model that may not be better than v6, but I think it is worth sharing.

        This model can restore the light and shadow of the original majicmix v2, but with increased realism while still keeping the basic aesthetic of the face. I have tested other face loras and they work fine. Please use adetailer and put the face lora in it.

        v6 is here. v5 is not good as I played for a while and see the results from yours. Therefore a v6 is urgent.

Use Euler for close up, and Euler a for others. Again, don't use facial restoration, use After detailer instead! All my samples used adetailer without lora.

5th edtion is coming soon. I've posted a preview version with the face of nwsj.

Use Euler as sampler.

Please don't use Face Restoration!

If your face comes out badly, use after detailer instead.

lora：GitHub - hako-mikan/sd-webui-lora-block-weight

I apologize for using lora block weight in the example images of the previous edition, which confused most of you and made it difficult for you to replicate my examples. Therefore, in the newer editions, I did not use any lora in my showcase. If you would like to learn about lora block weight, please refer to: https://github.com/hako-mikan/sd-webui-lora-block-weight

A good looking model, suitable for NSFW and dark scene (because I added noiseoffset). long-range facial detail require inpainting to achieve the best results. You can also use after detailer.

I recommended positive prompts: Best quality, masterpiece, ultra high res, (photorealistic:1.4), 1girl, if you want darker picture, add: in the dark, deep shadow, low key, etc. Use ng_deepnegative_v1_75t and badhandv4 in negative prompt. I've used a bug-fixed version of DPM++ 2M Karras, you can check this out: https://civitai.com/models/35966/dpm-2m-alt-karras-sampler

Recommended Parameters:

            * I had CLIP skip 2 on some pics (all of them for version 4)
            * I had ENSD: 31337 for basically all of them
            * All of them had highres.fix or img2img at higher resolution.
            * I don't use restore faces, as it washes out the painting effect
            * Versions >4 require no LoRA for anime style. For version 3 I suggest to use one of these LoRA networks at 0.35 weight:
            * https://civitai.com/models/4219 (the girls with glasses or if it says wanostyle)
            * https://huggingface.co/closertodeath/dpepmkmp/blob/main/last.pt (if it says mksk style)
            * https://civitai.com/models/4982/anime-screencap-style-lora (not used for any example but works great).

NOTE: if you find that the prompts below look "familiar" it's because I've taken them from other reviews and models here, to basically compare my model to other examples. Credits to the original authors. Thanks for the benchmark.
