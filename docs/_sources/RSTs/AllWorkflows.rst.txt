Current Objectives

=============
First Efforts
=============

Initially, characters such as Charlotte were developed in MidJourney. Paid for a subscription for same. Subsequently discover LeonardoAI... Victoria evolved in Leonardo.

Discovered Stable Diffusion.

Purchased the NVidia 3070 (8gig VRAM) card. Downloaded and (via Anaconda) installed Automatic1111 web-UI.

========
In A1111

The main objectives:

    * 1-to create as realistic (photo-real) characters as possible
    * 2-create *consistent* characters (back to MidJourney for this)
    * 3-have multiple characters in a scene
    * 4-have those multiple characters be unique (different from each other)
    * 5-have those multiple characters be reproduceable

Was able to achieve 1, 2, 3 and 4. Installed but did not invoke roop. Discovered ComfyUI, and migrated all activities to ComfyUI
