Foreword
********

These pages are all about sharing what I've sort-of picked up using ComfyUI and Stable Diffusion.

I have rather gravitated towards ComfyUI as my Stable Diffusion interface because of its flexibility through the use of nodes. These pages reflect my current uderstanding and use of this interface. I still have much to learn and explore in this rapidly expanding world of AI-based graphics. Hope my meanderings prove useful to someone.



******************
Current Objectives
******************

=============
First Efforts
=============

Initially, characters such as Charlotte were developed in MidJourney. Paid for a subscription for same. Subsequently discover LeonardoAI... Victoria evolved in Leonardo.

Discovered Stable Diffusion.

Purchased the NVidia 3070 (8gig VRAM) card. Downloaded and (via Anaconda) installed Automatic1111 web-UI.

========
In A1111
========

The main objectives:

    * 1-to create as realistic (photo-real) characters as possible
    * 2-create *consistent* characters (back to MidJourney for this)
    * 3-have multiple characters in a scene
    * 4-have those multiple characters be unique (different from each other)
    * 5-have those multiple characters be reproduceable

Was able to achieve 1, 2, 3 and 4. Installed but did not invoke roop. Discovered ComfyUI, and migrated all activities to ComfyUI.

As of September, 2023, have cancelled all subscriptions to Leonardo and MidJourney.

==========
In ComfyUI
==========

The main objectives:

    * 1-to create as realistic (photo-real) characters as possible   [DONE]
    * 2-create *consistent* characters [DONE using roop]
    * 3-have multiple characters in a scene [DONE]
    * 4-have those multiple characters be unique and reproduceable [DONE dual roop]
    * 5-have those multiple characters interact
    * 6-create and clothe the characters differently
    * 7-develop poses / LoRA / LyCORIS etc



=====================
Consistent Characters
=====================

The first characters (Charlotte, Victoria, Mabel, etc) were created for an odd little novella I was writing, one that has sort-of stalled as what I started writing seemed, with time, a bit trite and uninspired. They were 'created' in MidJourney and LeonardoAI. I've since gone to using `This Person Does Not Exist <https://this-person-does-not-exist.com/en>`_ as the faces are a lot less airbrushed and produce far more realistic-looking individuals (using roop). There is only one (heavily doctored) real person *base* for all the images on these pages.
