These pages are all about sharing what I've sort-of picked up using ComfyUI and Stable Diffusion.

I have rather gravitated towards ComfyUI as my Stable Diffusion interface because of its flexibility through the use of nodes. These pages reflect my current uderstanding and use of this interface. I still have much to learn and explore in this rapidly expanding world of AI-based graphics. Hope my meanderings prove useful to someone.



******************
Current Objectives
******************

=============
First Efforts
=============

.. image:: https://www.tightbytes.com/art/images/Cui/23/Charlotte.png
    :width: 600px

Initially, characters such as Charlotte were developed in MidJourney. Paid for a subscription for same. Subsequently discover LeonardoAI... Victoria evolved in Leonardo.

Discovered Stable Diffusion.

Purchased the NVidia 3070 (8gig VRAM) card. Downloaded and (via Anaconda) installed Automatic1111 web-UI.

========
In A1111
========

The main objectives:

    * 1-to create as realistic (photo-real) characters as possible
    * 2-create *consistent* characters (back to MidJourney for this)
    * 3-have multiple characters in a scene
    * 4-have those multiple characters be unique (different from each other)
    * 5-have those multiple characters be reproduceable

Was able to achieve 1, 2, 3 and 4. Installed but did not invoke roop. Discovered ComfyUI, and migrated all activities to ComfyUI.

As of September, 2023, have cancelled all subscriptions to Leonardo and MidJourney.

==========
In ComfyUI
==========

The main objectives:

    * 1-to create as realistic (photo-real) characters as possible **[DONE]**
    * 2-create *consistent* characters **[DONE using roop]**
    * 3-have multiple characters in a scene **[DONE]**
    * 4-have those multiple characters be unique and reproduceable **[DONE dual roop]**
    * 5-characters will be anatomically correct (minimal deformities)
    * 6-have those multiple characters interact (more than just staring blankly)
    * 7-clothe the characters differently
    * 8-develop poses / LoRA / LyCORIS etc

=====================
Consistent Characters
=====================

.. image:: https://www.tightbytes.com/art/images/Cui/23/Charlotte-Robyn-Library.png
    :width: 400px

The first characters (Charlotte, Victoria, Mabel, etc) were created for an odd little novella I was writing, one that has sort-of stalled as what I started writing seemed, with time, a bit trite and uninspired. They were 'created' in MidJourney and later LeonardoAI. I've since gone to using `This Person Does Not Exist <https://thispersondoesnotexist.com>`_ as the faces are a lot less airbrushed and produce far more realistic-looking individuals (using roop). There is only one (heavily doctored) real person *base* for all the images on these pages. 

More on how roop can be affected by prompts and other settings in a bit.

Here we are in October 2023 and the objectives haven't changed much. What's done is achieved - and consistently so - but the hand deformities frustratingly persist:

Note the hands (rendered 06.Oct.23) - Priority-One is sorting this.

=============================
23.09.25 Nodes and Objectives
=============================

---------------------
Character Interaction
---------------------

Objective: getting consistent interaction is a bit of a thorny one. I currently can have characters holding hands and 'embrace' but in SD1.5, a more intimate display of affection - i.e., a kiss - tends to distort the faces near the contact point. (Added 04.10.23: *appears to be a* **roop** *thing*).


---------
Node Work
---------

From Automatic1111, I really missed 'HiRez-Fix'. Well, got that working, sort-of. Using the Efficiency Pack really cleared up a bunch of messy noodles.

Reminders [to Myself] of Sphinx Stuff
*************************************

=============
Inline images
=============

For externally-stored images (most will be stored on Tightbytes, for my pages)::

	* .. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/Music/CReinecke/CReinecke1890.jpg

and for those stored with the data files::

======================
Embedded YouTube Video
======================

This code::

   .. raw:: html
   
   <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/123xxxXXXyZ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

   <hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray">

Should have 11 characters::

	3LbsmS5TJXA
	123xxxXXXyZ

Key to note is the difference in the link in the raw html syntax vs the actual youtube link::

	https://www.youtube.com/embed/123xxxXXXyZ
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9USTddwNoXU

Basically, "embed/" instead of "watch?v=".



==============
Embedded Audio
==============

This code::

	.. raw:: html

		<audio controls="controls">
		  <source src="http://tightbytes.com/music/Sketches/Sketch11.mp3" type="audio/wav">
		  Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element. 
		</audio>

...produces:

.. raw:: html

    <audio controls="controls">
      <source src="http://tightbytes.com/music/Sketches/Sketch11.mp3" type="audio/wav">
      Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element. 
    </audio>

.. raw:: html
   
   <hr style="height:1px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray">



==========================
Embedded Non-youtube Video
==========================

This code::

	.. raw:: html

	   <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://tightbytes.com/videos/projects/garden/Aj-SHTrench.mp4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
	   
	   |
	   

...produces:

==================
Creating Dotpoints
==================

Once you've decided:

  * Select A.

  * Select B. 

  * To identify C.

  * Finally, click on D.


Note: *setting things to italics like this makes more impact - these have yielded reasonable results. You will almost certainly find better settings, which is the whole point of sharing this*.



================
Links Management
================

Here's a typical example of embedding a link: Blender-for-Mac users, please refer to the `Mac user help <http://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/6173/where-does-console-output-go>`_ page.




==========================
Horizontal Separator Lines
==========================

The code is this (minus the '*')::

	* .. raw:: html
   
   <hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray">

...which produces the following grey horizonal bar to help separate sctions (like the one below).

.. raw:: html
   
   <hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray">

===========================
Changing Settings in Chrome
===========================

These tips pertain to Chrome for Mac: doesn't matter much which version of the Mac operating system, as far as I can tell. Open the Chrome browser:

.. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Cm_Chrome-4.png

Mine is already open which is why I've got a white dot to the left of it. A key link on your Chrome browser is the one to your settings page. This is in the upper right-hand corner of the browser:

.. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Cm_Chrome-5.png

When you click on this, you get the following menu, from which you select 'Settings':

.. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Cm_Chrome-6.png

However, to turn off 'dark mode' in Chrome, you actually go to a new search page:

.. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Cm_Chrome-1.png

At the bottom right-hand corner is another settings link:

.. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Cm_Chrome-2.png

If you click on the 'Dark theme: On' menu item, it will turn Dark Theme: Off.

.. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/conundrums/Cm_Chrome-3.png

Hope this helps.
